    " We are interested in the “Tech Mental Health Survey” dataset, which was a survey carried out in 2014 focusing on individual attitudes in the tech workplace towards mental health and mental health disorders related questions. Each responder/sample is required to provide some personal information anonymously, including: **Age**, **Gender**, **Country** (from), **state** (if from US), form of employment **self-employer**, whether they **work remotely**, whether they work in **tech company**, and if there have a **family history** of mental illness. Then the responder was asked some key questions related to mental health and mental health disorders and replied with his/her own answer/attitude on the issue. The following is a list of questions asked by the survey:\n",
