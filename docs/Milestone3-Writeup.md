Milestone 3 writeup 

1.	The usefulness of the feedback you received:
a.	There are three most useful suggestions that we received from our advisors:
i.	Make the plots more interactive: solved this by implanting the leaflet.
ii.	Change the color scheme of the bar chart to color blind friendly color: this suggestion is quite important since it is one of the key points mentioned in the class. Based on this suggestion, we already changed the original colors to color blind friendly colors;
iii.	Explaining what “working flexibility” is with text: this suggestion is also necessary since the working flexibility is ourselves defined variable, which is not included in the original dataset. We already added text below the condition selection section to explain this variable.
b.	Other useful suggestions:
i.	Rephrase the condition selection choices “all condition included” to “all” or “all respondents”. This change will make the condition control panel less ambiguous.
ii.	Rephrase “Positive” and “Negative” in the first plot to “Yes” and “No, which are more related with the responses.
c.	Suggestions we think not very useful
i.	Add another selection in “Gender” as “others”, which includes the transgender and homosexual groups. We think this is applicable in most other cases, but in our case, the usefulness of this suggestion is limited by the sample size we have access to.

2. Did the feedback process lead to an improved app?

a) Without any hesitation we can see it definitely helped us refine aspects of this app and clarify what we wanted to convey. Our initial concern was that we were conveying too much information, however, what came across to us was that it was just the right amount of information we were conveying but that color, and interactive map aspects would add to the app without making it more convoluted. We were able to learn about how people first viewed our app, and what caught their eye when trying to use it. That helped us realize the importance of the state map, and clarify the meaning of our wigets since both are fundamental to what we are trying to convey.

3. Reflection on Changes from Milestone 2 

a) There wasn't anything too time consuming, and we decided to implement an interactrive map that was considerably more complex, but we were able to build it. Our objective did change in that we weren't sure how our initial goal of offering value through our app to business leaders was going to playout, and decided to offer it more from a policy and research perspective on mental health dynamics. Using the state, and country comparisons related to our questions of interest. You can learn alot about how demographics and cultural factors relate to mental health and this information could be quite useful to a researcher interested in some of these differences, or someone focused on policy-making around mental health. I think reflecting on this helped us find a better niche for this app, and the design depicts this clarity.

b) The better design choice was adding greater value to our map by making it interactive where an average response is shown is the user hovers over the state with their mouse. It just fits with the theme of our app more nicely and really makes it sharper in it's presentation.

We learned alot both about ourselves and through others feedback this week, and believe it helped us develop an even better product!
