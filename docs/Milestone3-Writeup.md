Milestone 3 writeup 

1.	The usefulness of the feedback you received:
a.	There are three most useful suggestions that we received from our advisors:
i.	Make the plots more interactive: solved this by implanting the leaflet.
ii.	Change the color scheme of the bar chart to color blind friendly color: this suggestion is quite important since it is one of the key points mentioned in the class. Based on this suggestion, we already changed the original colors to color blind friendly colors;
iii.	Explaining what “working flexibility” is with text: this suggestion is also necessary since the working flexibility is ourselves defined variable, which is not included in the original dataset. We already added text below the condition selection section to explain this variable.
b.	Other useful suggestions:
i.	Rephrase the condition selection choices “all condition included” to “all” or “all respondents”. This change will make the condition control panel less ambiguous.
ii.	Rephrase “Positive” and “Negative” in the first plot to “Yes” and “No, which are more related with the responses.
c.	Suggestions we think not very useful
i.	Add another selection in “Gender” as “others”, which includes the transgender and homosexual groups. We think this is applicable in most other cases, but in our case, the usefulness of this suggestion is limited by the sample size we have access to.
